Summary:
A comprehensive overview of my responsibilities and daily practices as a Security Analyst and DevSecOps Engineer, including the tools and technologies I rely on to secure and optimize systems.

Breaking Into the Industry
After dedicating several months to intensive learning and navigating a series of interviews, I was fortunate to join Cytrusst Intelligence Pvt. Ltd, a respected cybersecurity organization. My role as a Security Analyst and DevSecOps Engineer has allowed me to integrate security best practices into development and operations workflows effectively.

My Day-to-Day DevSecOps Toolbox
Below is a detailed list of technologies and services that I engage with regularly, spanning infrastructure setup, deployment automation, and security management:

üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure
Linux Operating Systems: Proficient in managing servers running Ubuntu and Amazon Linux, ensuring stable and secure environments.

AWS EC2 Instances: Responsible for provisioning and maintaining secure cloud servers to support various workloads.

Elastic Block Store (EBS): Implementing persistent storage solutions for data durability and accessibility.

AWS CloudTrail: Continuously monitoring API activity for auditing and compliance purposes.

S3: Managing scalable object storage for reliable and efficient web infrastructure.

üê≥ Containers & Orchestration
Docker: Building, deploying, and managing containerized applications to ensure consistency across environments.

Docker Compose & Swarm: Coordinating multi-container applications and enabling clustering for scalability.

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS):

Currently in the learning phase, gaining foundational knowledge of Kubernetes concepts such as Persistent Volumes (PV), Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), ConfigMaps, Secrets, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), and GitOps deployment with ArgoCD.

Planning to implement Kubernetes workloads and best practices as part of future projects.

Utilizing ArgoCD for GitOps-driven continuous deployment, enabling declarative management of Kubernetes clusters.

üîÅ CI/CD Pipelines
Jenkins: Developing and maintaining build, test, and deployment pipelines that support automated and reliable software delivery.

GitHub: Managing source code with version control and facilitating collaborative pull request workflows.

Bitbucket: Overseeing repository management and branch workflows to support team collaboration and code quality.

üõ°Ô∏è Security Operations
SentinelOne Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR): Monitoring and mitigating endpoint threats with advanced detection capabilities.

Wazuh Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Performing centralized log analysis and threat detection.

ManageEngine Endpoint Central: Overseeing asset management and ensuring timely patch deployment.

üåê Web Layer
NGINX:

Acting as a reverse proxy to distribute traffic efficiently.

Configuring SSL/TLS certificates through Let‚Äôs Encrypt to secure communications.

Implementing load balancing to ensure application availability and scalability.

üìã Workflow Management
Jira: Facilitating access management, change control, and incident tracking through structured and agile workflows to maintain operational efficiency.

What I‚Äôve Learned
Security and DevOps are inherently interconnected disciplines. Success in DevSecOps requires not only maintaining uptime and implementing automation but also embedding security controls throughout every layer of the technology stack.

For those aspiring to build a career in DevSecOps, I recommend developing a strong foundation in the following areas:

Cloud platforms, particularly AWS

Command-line proficiency in Linux environments

Building and managing CI/CD pipelines

Familiarity with key security tools and frameworks

Scripting skills in Bash or Python to automate routine tasks and processes

Looking Ahead üë®‚Äçüíª
Every day presents new challenges, whether integrating cutting-edge tools or addressing emerging vulnerabilities. This continuous evolution is both demanding and rewarding.

For those interested in this field, I encourage starting with small, consistent efforts. DevSecOps is not a sprint but a long-term commitment that demands ongoing learning, adaptation, and automation.
