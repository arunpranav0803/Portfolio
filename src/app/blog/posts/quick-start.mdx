## The Beginning

I completed my **BE in Computer Science Engineering** from *Bannari Amman Institute of Technology*, Sathyamangalam, Tamil Nadu. I didn’t get placed through campus interviews — a major setback that pushed me to take control of my path.

In **June 2024**, I joined **JSpiders**, a well-known software training institute in Bangalore.

## Full Stack Development Phase

At JSpiders, I started with **Java Full Stack** development:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Core Java, Hibernate, Servlets
- **Database**: MySQL
- **UI Library**: ReactJS

Alongside technical training, I practiced **aptitude** and **verbal reasoning**, which are essential for job interviews.

## My DevOps Awakening

While learning to deploy my full-stack apps, I got curious about infrastructure. That’s when I discovered **DevOps** — and my journey took a new direction.

I began learning:

- 🐧 **Linux** (basic commands, shell scripting)
- 🌐 **Networking** (OSI model, IP, DNS, Firewalls, NAT)
- ☁️ **AWS** (EC2, S3, VPC, NAT Gateway, ALB, CloudWatch, RDS, Lambda)
- 🔁 **SDLC & Agile** (Agile/Scrum ceremonies, Jira boards)
- 🛠️ **CI/CD Tools**:
  - Jenkins
  - Docker
  - Ansible
  - Terraform
- 🔗 **Version Control**:
  - Git (init, clone, push, pull, branches, merge)
  - GitHub

---

## First Major Deployment

I successfully deployed my **React portfolio** using:

- Jenkins (build)
- Docker (containerize)
- Tomcat (host)
- AWS EC2 (infrastructure)

This project gave me confidence and sparked my passion for automation and infrastructure.

## Final Thoughts

The journey wasn’t linear — but every step, failure, and retry built me up. Whether you’re a recent graduate or switching careers, know that **self-learning + persistence = success**.
