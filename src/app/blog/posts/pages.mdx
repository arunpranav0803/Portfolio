## What I’ve Learned

Security and DevOps go hand in hand. It’s not just about uptime or automation — **it’s about securing every layer** while making delivery fast and efficient.

If you're aiming for a DevSecOps role, get comfortable with:

- **Cloud (AWS)**
- **Linux command line**
- **CI/CD**
- **Security tools**
- **Scripting (Bash or Python)**

**Looking Ahead 👨‍💻**

Every day is a new challenge — whether it’s integrating a new tool or mitigating a vulnerability. But I wouldn’t have it any other way.

If this path excites you, **start small and be consistent**. DevSecOps isn’t a sprint — it’s a long game of learning, adapting, and automating.
