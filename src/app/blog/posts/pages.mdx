## The Beginning

I completed my **Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science Engineering** from *Bannari Amman Institute of Technology*, located in Sathyamangalam, Tamil Nadu. During my academic journey, I developed a strong foundation in core computer science principles and programming, which fueled my passion for software development and technology.

Following graduation, I was determined to enhance my practical skills and industry readiness. To achieve this, in **June 2024**, I enrolled at **JSpiders**, a reputed software training institute based in Bangalore. The structured curriculum and hands-on approach at JSpiders provided me with the opportunity to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, preparing me to take confident steps toward a career in software development and IT infrastructure.

## Full Stack Development Phase

At JSpiders, I started with **Java Full Stack** development:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Core Java, Hibernate, Servlets  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **UI Library**: ReactJS  

Alongside technical training, I practiced **aptitude** and **verbal reasoning**, which are essential for job interviews.

## My DevOps Awakening

While learning to deploy my full-stack apps, I developed a keen interest in infrastructure and automation. This led me to explore DevOps technologies, including:

- üêß **Linux** (fundamental commands and shell scripting)  
- üåê **Networking** (OSI model, IP addressing, DNS, firewalls, NAT)  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS** (EC2, S3, AMI, ELB, VPC, CloudWatch, SNS, RDS, Lambda)  
- Git (Version Control System)  
- GitHub (Remote Repository Hosting)  
- Maven (Build Tool)  
- Jenkins (CI/CD Tool)  
- Docker & DockerHub (Containerization Tool)  
- Ansible (Configuration Management Tool)  
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code Tool)  
- Kubernetes (Container Orchestration Tool ‚Äì Currently Learning)
